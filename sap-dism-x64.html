I have attempted the install from both Windows update and from downloading sfc scannow found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them amp#x200B; I've tried many different things such as dism online repair etc etc. It always says I need a source.

Hi, I usually fix things by myself and within days but for the first time, I am really stuck and really confused. Please HELP. BEFORE YOU GIVE UP ON ME DUE TO THE LENGHT OF THIS POST, HERE IS A TLDR ATTEMPT: 3 month old GPU (RX 580), system stable for months/years before this. Used CRU + Updated my drivers (19.1.1 -gt 19.2.2) for a game (Apex Legends) basicly broke my windows, then seemed to have bricked my display/GPU. GPU came back to "life" when I put it in my GF's setup I will try my best to keep this as short as possible. amp#x200B; Background: First I am trying to fixing this for a family friend that actually got me into computers when I was about 13. So I've already invested way more time in this that any normal human would but he's always been someone that's helped me as a trouble making adolescent etc so I don't mind. Also I am very aware simply imaging the HD and reinstalling Win 10 would fix the problem very easily, unfortunately I discussed I believe it has been happening since last Sunday as this entire week has been unsuccessful on updating my system. Every time I check for updates, it seems to be "doing" so for like 5 seconds until reporting a service error: "We couldn't connect to update service. We'll try again later, or you can check now. If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the Internet." I've manually restarted the bits , wuauserv and WaaSMedicSvc services, and also followed online guides.

So recently I bought Rainbow Six: Seige, but unfortunately, BattleEye (the anti-cheat) doesn't like Windows test-signing mode, now you might be wondering why I had test signing mode on, the reason being, well, my computer wouldn't boot without it on.

The next task I created was to upgrade the operating system. Hi All. Firstly I just want to declare I am a complete SCCM noob here so please take it easy on me. To familiarize my self with SCCM I am trying do a simple windows 10 deployment to a new VMWARE VM using PXE boot on the VM .
